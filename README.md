# House-Price-Detection
Here are the key steps from the house price prediction project without the code:

1. **Import Libraries**: Import required libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning. It including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

2. **Load and Explore Data**: Use Pandas to load the dataset and perform an initial exploration to check dimensions, summary statistics, and data types.

3. **Handle Missing Values**: Identify and handle missing values by dropping rows with any missing data.

4. **Data Visualization**: Create visualizations to understand the distribution of the target variable (`SalePrice`), including log transformation to normalize the data.

5. **Feature Selection and Correlation Analysis**: Analyze correlations between features and the target variable to identify potential predictors. Generate a correlation heatmap for a comprehensive view. S

6. **Model Training with Linear Regression**: 
   - Define the target and features.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Train a linear regression model on the training data.
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the training and testing data.

7. **Machine Learning with PyCaret**:
   - Initialize the PyCaret environment, specifying the target variable.
   - Use PyCaret to compare different regression models and select the best one.
   - Fine-tune the best model and evaluate its performance.
   - Make predictions and save the best model for future use.

These steps provide a structured approach to predicting house prices using both traditional and automated machine learning techniques.
